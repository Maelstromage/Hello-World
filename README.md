# Hello-World
As Christopher Walken walks by he stares down into your eyes, from his lips "Hello... World". 
You ask yourself what is Christopher Walken doing here. The taste of blood in mouth and the barrel of a gun answer your question.
"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light" he says.
Why does this sound familiar, where have you heard this before?
What does it mean?
